# AI merge queue operations

Runbook for the queue service specified in
[`docs/redesign/specs/ai-merge-queue.md`](../redesign/specs/ai-merge-queue.md). This file grows
with each stream; the entries below are the ones increment 0 needs.

## GitHub App

The service acts through its own GitHub App, `TauCeti Queue`, owned by `TauCetiProject`. The
increment 0 shadow repair task and the status endpoint run on its API budget, never on a personal
account's rate limit.

The App exists: slug `tauceti-queue`, App ID `5607007`, created 2026-11-04, with the permissions and
events below confirmed from `gh api /apps/tauceti-queue`. Its webhook address is
`https://queue.taucetiproject.org/webhook/github`, registered inactive until the service host and that
Cloudflare hostname exist; the deployment stream uses the same name.

Registration is prefilled by:

```sh
uv run python scripts/tauceti_queue_github_app.py url
```

Open the printed URL as an organization owner, set a webhook secret in the form (GitHub does not
accept one through the URL), and create the App. The URL requests exactly these repository
permissions: contents write, pull requests write, issues write, checks read, statuses write,
actions write, workflows write, metadata read; and subscribes to these events: pull request,
pull request review, issue comment, status, check run, check suite, push, workflow run. Pass
`--webhook-url https://<host>/webhook/github` once the service host exists; until then the webhook
is registered inactive and switched on from the App settings later.

After creation, generate a private key on the App's settings page and record it together with the
App ID and slug:

```sh
uv run python scripts/tauceti_queue_github_app.py save --app-id <id> --slug <slug> < ~/Downloads/tauceti-queue.*.private-key.pem
```

The credentials live in `~/.config/tauceti-queue/` on the service host, mode 0600, next to the
existing `~/.config/tauceti-bors/` layout:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `github-app.json` | App ID, slug, owner, the requested permissions and events |
| `github-private-key.pem` | the App's private key |
| `github-webhook-secret` | the webhook secret entered in the form |

Install the App on `TauCetiProject/TauCeti` and on the scratch repository
`TauCetiProject/TauCetiQueueScratch` only.

## Scratch repository

`TauCetiProject/TauCetiQueueScratch` carries the TauCeti workflow files and a small Lean library so
the cutover rehearsal (work plan stream I) can run every acceptance scenario the repository can
express against synthetic PRs. The service treats it as an opted-in repository like any other.

## Host and staging capacity

The service runs on a fleet host with PostgreSQL and a public HTTPS endpoint for webhooks through the
existing Cloudflare account. Staging builds need runner capacity reserved for staging alone; the
investigation of today's placement and the exact reservation are recorded in
[`status.md`](status.md) until the deployment stream writes them here.
